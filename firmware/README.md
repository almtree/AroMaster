# Firmware lastest version: V1.7

The **Aro-Master** software/firmware runs as a '_daemon_' (a computer program that runs as a background process) on the Raspberry Pi and exposes its UI (user interface) through the embedded web-server.

Once connected to your PLAN (your home or local network) one can access the ARO-Master web-server using a web browser (that supports HTML 5) using the URL **http://aro.local** or **http://aro.home**.

### The web page consists of
- System data
- Weather data
- Setup and configuration
- Image from the sky camera (if available)
- Meteo satellite image

Below are some examples of the interface screens.
