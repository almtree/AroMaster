# Automated Remote Observatory Control &amp; Guard

ARO-Master is a project to implement an affordable and easy to build remote control system for Automated Remote/Robotic Observatories.
It's composed of two components:
ARO-Master control box:
Hardware & firmware that implement theserver/daemon for Observatory control (remote andlocal). This is the main brain that allows you to connectand control all the equipment, open/close the roof, seeweather conditions, see the sky, see the observatoryinterior, control user login, control the Piers etc.
Pier-Relays: relays box for each pier that connected to ARO-Master, allows you to turn on and off the equipment (mount, cameras, flat panels, etc.)
